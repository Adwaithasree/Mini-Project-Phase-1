# Mini Project Phase 1 - Data Preprocessing

This is my submission for **Mini Project Phase 1**.  
The dataset used is the **Financial Sample dataset**, which I cleaned and preprocessed in Excel.

## Files in this Repository
- **Mini Project Phase 1.xlsx** → Cleaned dataset in Excel format  
- **Mini Project Phase 1.csv** → Same cleaned dataset saved as CSV  

## Preprocessing Steps I Did
- Renamed column names for clarity  
- Removed unwanted/empty columns  
- Fixed data type issues (like Year column warning)  
- Checked for duplicates and missing values (none found)  
- Made sure formatting is consistent  

## About this Project
This dataset is now ready for analysis and visualization.  
It is a part of my Mini Project Phase 1 submission.
